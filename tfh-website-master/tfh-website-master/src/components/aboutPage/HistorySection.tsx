          The Vision of The worship atmosphere started in the place of prayer at a time
          in January 2023. Moses Praise had just resigned from an executive
          position in one of the leading new generation banks in Kenya, Nairobi with the sole
          intention to run a full time ministerial assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          From January 1st 2023, he began to seek the face of the Lord for direction in
          full time ministry. As he prayed, a word came clearly from the Lord that he
          should start an independent ministry. This was quite unexpected and incredible
          to him because he went to pray with the mindset of a ministry in worship atmosphere Church in 
          Kenya but God began to point him in another direction
          entirely.

          He promptly shared this with his wife, who at that time felt he should focus on
          the work at hand without plunging into something new. He kept praying and also
          requested that God should convince her. Then came August 2003, after a series of
          prayers, she became convinced and moves were made for proper and procedural
          exiting of the organization he was serving in at that time.
